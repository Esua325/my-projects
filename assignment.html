    <p>Aquafina (/ˌɑːkwəˈfiːnə/) is an American brand of purified bottled water that is produced by PepsiCo, consisting of both unflavored and flavored water. 
        The Aquafina brand name is also licensed for use on multiple skin care products, including lip balm and wrinkle cream.
        [1] It was first distributed in Wichita, Kansas in 1994, before becoming more widely sold across the United States, Canada, Spain, Peru (called "San Carlos"), Lebanon, Turkey, the GCC countries, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India to compete with The Coca-Cola Company's Dasani and Dr. Pepper Snapple's Deja Blue.

    <p><strong>Product variation</strong></p>
    <p>Aquafina Pure Water, the primary unflavored product produced under the Aquafina brand, is derived from local municipal water sources and goes through a purification process that incorporates reverse osmosis, ultraviolet, and ozone sterilization.
        Beginning on July 27, 2007, a disclaimer was added to each bottle of Aquafina, stating the water comes from a "public source".[5]
        In Canada, the current 1.5 litres (51 US fl oz) bottle of water displays "Demineralized Treat Water". In response to concerns amongst environmental advocates who raised questions over the disclosure of water sources, a PepsiCo spokeswoman stated, "If this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, then it's a reasonable thing to do."[6]

    <p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>
    <p>Aquafina is distributed in 12 US fluid ounces (0.35 L), 500 millilitres (17 US fl oz), 20 US fluid ounces (0.59 L), 24 US fluid ounces (0.71 L), 1 litre (34 US fl oz), 1.5 litres (51 US fl oz) bottles.
        The bottled water industry has drawn criticism for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging, which consumes additional petrochemicals.[13]

    <p>The packaging has evolved from its original iteration to partially offset the environmental impacts of production and shipment. 
        This has primarily involved packaging weight reduction.

    <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced by approximately 50%, to 10.9 grams (0.38 oz), with a packaging redesign in 2009 which, according to the company, resulted in the use of 75 million fewer pounds of plastic during the production process.[2]
